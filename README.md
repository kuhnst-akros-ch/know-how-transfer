# know-how-transfer
Used to share information and code-snippets for Know-How transfers

## Potential topics for crash courses
- Spring Boot
- Bash scripting
- Docker container
- SQL
- Writing Java unit tests

## Format
The intended format for the crash courses is a series of casual sessions.
For each topic:
1. Introduction: Aim of the session
2. Talk: Check existing know-how
2. Talk: Basics of the topic
3. Examples: Show what can be done
4. Exercise: Apply learned know-how
5. Repeat 2â€“5 for subtopics

The idea is to share basic know-how, so you understand it at the end of a session.

You might not remember everything weeks after, but hopefully will feel comfortable to tackle such topics knowing that you understood it once at with a bit of online research will be able to do it again.

### Example: Format for Bash scripting
_This is a very rough example so you get the gist ;-)_
1. Introduction: Aim of the session
   1. Understand how bash commands interact
   2. See where bash scripts are used in most projects
   3. Write basic scripts today, feel capable of doing it again
2. Talk: Check existing know-how
   1. How well do you know Bash?
   2. How often do you have to write scripts?
   3. What scripts are in your projects? (CI/CD pipeline?)
2. Talk: Basics of the topic: STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR, pipe, exit codes
   1. Explain: STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR, pipe, exit codes
   2. Understand how commands in bash interact with each other
3. Examples: Show what can be done
   1. Show simple examples
   2. Show bash scripts used in CI/CD pipelines
   3. Show bash scripts used in Dockerfile to build containers
4. Exercise: Apply learned know-how
   1. Write examples together
   2. Apply understanding of STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR, pipe, exit codes

No subtopics to bash scripting planned.
