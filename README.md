## How We Roll

The idea: a series of laid-back, interactive sessions—not death-by-slideshow.  
For each topic, we’ll usually go like this:

1. **Introduction:** What’s the goal for today?
2. **Let’s Talk:** What do you already know? (No wrong answers!)
3. **Quick & Dirty Basics:** What’s this all about?
4. **Show & Tell:** See some real examples, maybe mess around a bit.
5. **Try It Out:** Get your hands dirty—small exercises, together.
6. *Repeat steps 2–5 for subtopics, if needed.*

It’s all about getting the basics down so you walk away thinking “I get it!”  
You might not remember every detail a month later, but you’ll *know* you cracked it once, and can Google your way back any time.

### 📝 Example: Bash Scripting Crash Course

_Here’s how a session could look. Super rough sketch, just so you get the vibe!_

1. **Intro:** What’s the point today?
    - See where Bash scripts pop up in real projects.
    - Learn enough to write and tweak basic scripts.
    - Understand why Bash is everywhere.

2. **Let’s Talk:** How much Bash have you actually used?
    - Ever had to automate something?
    - Seen Bash in CI/CD or Dockerfiles?
    - Any Bash scripts lurking in your repos?

3. **Quick & Dirty Basics:** STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR, pipes, exit codes
    - What does “pipe” even mean?
    - Why do we care about exit codes?
    - How do commands talk to each other?

4. **Show & Tell:** Real-life examples
    - A dead simple Bash script
    - CI/CD pipeline snippets
    - Docker build scripts using Bash

5. **Try It Out:**
    - Write a tiny script together
    - Use pipes and see what happens
    - Play with STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR

_No subtopics planned for Bash—keeping it simple!_
