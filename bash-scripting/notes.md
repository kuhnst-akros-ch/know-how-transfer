Here’s a realistic estimate for a single **informal Bash scripting crash course**, assuming a **one-on-one or small group** and you want the session to be practical but not overwhelming.

# Typical session length: ~60–75 minutes

## 1. Introduction (5 min)

   Quick welcome, set the agenda, explain why Bash is useful.

   (“Today you’ll see where Bash pops up and why it’s worth knowing!”)

## 2. Let’s Talk / Check existing know-how (5–10 min)

   Ask: “Used Bash before? Automated something? Seen scripts in pipelines?”

   Listen and adapt the session a bit if there’s more/less experience.

## 3. Quick & Dirty Basics (15–20 min)

   Talk through STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR, pipes, exit codes—just enough theory.

   Show a few one-liners interactively, answer questions as you go.

## 4. Show & Tell (Examples) (10–15 min)

   Walk through 2–3 “real” examples from CI/CD, a Dockerfile, or a script from your codebase.

   Demo running a script, intentionally break something and fix it.

## 5. Try It Out (Exercise) (20–25 min)

   Get them to write or modify a small script.

   Play around with piping, redirection, exit codes.

   Help debug if things break (that’s where real learning happens).

**Total: 60–75 minutes**

If it’s going great and there are lots of questions, you could easily stretch to 90 minutes, but aiming for ~1 hour is usually perfect for energy and attention.
